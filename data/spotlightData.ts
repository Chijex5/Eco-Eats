  achievement: 'Rescued and redistributed 2,500 meals in one month',
  story: `Amara runs a small restaurant in Lagos and was troubled by the amount of perfectly good food 
that went to waste each day. After joining EcoEats as a food partner, she now lists her surplus meals 
every evening. Within the first month, she helped feed over 2,500 people while reducing her waste by 85%.

"I used to throw away food worth thousands of naira every week," Amara explains. "Now, I see that food 
going to students and families who really need it. It's not just good for business—it's good for my soul."`,
