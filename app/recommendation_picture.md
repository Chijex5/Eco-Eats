## Goal
Create a warm, hopeful first impression that feels like a modern charity website without feeling staged.

## Subject
Smiling children or a family receiving a meal box in a community setting. Aim for joy, dignity, and connection.

## Composition
- Wide landscape (16:9 or 3:2).
- Keep the main subjects slightly off-center with clean negative space for headline text.
- Avoid busy backgrounds; shallow depth of field helps.

## Color and lighting
- Warm daylight, soft shadows.
- Natural tones with subtle greens or earth colors that match the current palette.

## Usage notes
- If used behind text, plan for a subtle dark overlay (30-40%) to keep text readable.
- Avoid extreme contrast or saturated reds that can clash with the UI.

## Accessibility (alt text draft)
